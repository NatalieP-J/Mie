Carl:

I will send two tables of refractive indices of silicate materials I
have been using recently (e.g., Kim and Martin ApJ 462, 296, 1996 and
references therein).  These go back to about the time of the Martin and
Rouleau article and are quite similar to what was used then.  The tables
are laid out as follows:


| this simply indicates that the table contains n - 1, rather than n,
| which is better for accuracy at high energies
| Use n and k to generate eps1 and eps2
V
0 ! silicate DL, Huffman&Stapp, Reilman&Manson, Henke et al. den=3.3 wt=172

   wavelength  n - 1       k              eps1      eps2
   in microns 

The files are rosil.refr and rosilx.refr.  The second one is just for
finer energy resolution in the FUV; it starts at wavelength 1.24E-02
microns ~= 100 eV and extends about a factor 3 further, to ~10 KeV.

I hope this is satisfactory.

Regards,

Peter
